            	<h4>About This Project</h4>
            	<p>This project is a passion project of mine being made as a spec video. A spec video's purpose is to be viewed by a client with the intention of showing them what I am able to do as an editor on a technical level as well as show them the unique editing style I bring to the table. This particular spec video is something I've wanted to make for a long time, and intend to post to my <cite><a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXK7QbSusnr1_dzkZ8Hw1qg" target="blank">YouTube channel</a></cite> as soon as it is done. The current due date slated for it is <time datetime="2023-06-09">June 9, 2023</time>. During the period in which the full movie is not done, parts of it will be released as seperate episodes to aid in viewer retention and channel growth.</p>

            	<h4>About This Project</h4>
            	<p>This project was originally created for a client with the objective of telling an effective story using only audio elements. Using a variety of audio elements, the story was required to have a variety of voice actors, sound effects, and music tracks. The client handed all creative control in terms of story over to me. The biggest challenge with this project was the time limit placed on the final draft. The story was required to be no longer than 3 1/2 minutes; this was accomploished by taking the original draft, which was just over 4 1/2 minutes, and trimming it, keeping only the story essentials while keeping the essence and style of the original draft. I now control the rights to this project, and intend to add a text element to it for accesibility and shareability purposes. The final product will be posted to my YouTube channel. There is no current due date set for this project.</p>
