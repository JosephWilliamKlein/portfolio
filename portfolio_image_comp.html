				<h2>Lake of Rot</h2>
        		<img src="images/09_postcard_project_mockup.png" alt="lake of rot postcard mockup" width="700"><br>
        		<h3>Before & After</h3>
        		<img src="images/11_postcard_project_unedited.jpg" alt="lake of rot unedited" width="300">
        		<img src="images/10_postcard_project_complete.jpg" alt="lake of rot completed" width="300">
        		<h3>Objective</h3>
        		<p>The client requested a complete image composition be made to showcase a location as it is meant to be viewed and to fully format the composition to a postcard format. The image composition was to include lighting corrections and color grading to show to the location at its best, utilize external text and image assets to give the image a genuine postcard design, and be print ready. The design was requested to have a unique tone of voice while remaining true to the locationâ€™s real-life tone of voice.</p>
        		<h3>Challenges</h3>
        		<p>The most notable challenge was the significant change in lighting and color grade the client requested to make the image composition match the desired location. This was achieved by utilizing adjustment layers and smart objects to adjust the hue, saturation, and luma of the initial composition while utilizing layer masks and selection tools to remove extraneous details and change light levels of difficult image areas. The composition was then compiled into camera RAW to add additional texture.</p>

				<h2>The Divine Immortals</h2>
        		<img src="images/12_tdi_project_complete.jpg" alt="the divine immortals wallpaper complete" width="700">
        		<h3>Before & After</h3>
        		<img src="images/13_tdi_project_unedited.jpg" alt="the divine immortals wallpaper unedited" width="300">
        		<img src="images/14_tdi_project_example.jpg" alt="the divine immortals wallpaper without border" width="300">
        		<h3>Objective</h3>
        		<p>The client had no particular objective in mind. This photo is a part of the weekly submission I send to the client as part of a commision deal I currently have with them. I am to send them one image composition for their gaming community every week to help with recruiting outreach and culture building.</p>
        		<h3>Challenges</h3>
        		<p>The most notable challenge was blending the mist, figures, and background into one cohesive image. This was done by taking advantage of the cloud render filter in Photoshop and utilizing its camera RAW filters to take texture and clarity away from the completed photo while still color grading it.</p>
