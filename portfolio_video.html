				<h2>Behind the Scenes</h2>
        		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U4YyBG0pHCI" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        		<h4>Objective</h4>
        		<p>The client requested a video to be made showcasing various camera angles to tell an engaging story. The video and audio were expected to be edited to a professional standard as well as to give the video a unique style through color grading and audio effects. The client expected each requested shot to be incorporated into the video well, and for the video to meet the time requirement without going over it. The client gave complete creative control to the production team in terms of scripting.</p>
        		<h4>Challenges</h4>
        		<p>The most notable challenge was the lack of experience in the team. Said lack of experience lead to audio and lighting issues being present in the footage captured for this production. This challenge was overcome through the impressive teamwork displayed by team members despite their inexperience, and the mishaps were turned into stylistic choices through color grading and story rewrites to give the video an intentional improvised feeling while still retaining the original office-like tone.</p>

        		<h4>Objective</h4>
        		<p>The client requested a video to be made showcasing a variety of video production techniques from scripting to editing. The production of the video was to be conducted in whatever manner the team saw fit, and complete creative control was given to the crew as a result. Video and audio were expected to be edited to a professional standard and a color grade was to be added to create a unique style. The client's primary concern was that the video should have an engaging story above all else.</p>
        		<h4>Challenges</h4>
        		<p>The most notable challenge was the conflicting schedules between members of the team and the teams overall lack of experience. This challenge was overcome by carefully planning and scheduling days to shoot various parts of the video weeks in advance, going in order of what scenes were most convient to shoot at the time rather than in chronological order. The inexperenced members of the team were given the oppurtunity to work on the simpler tasks of audio capture, and were trained on camera work during the process of production.</p>
